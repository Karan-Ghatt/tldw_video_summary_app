For me
personally, I
don't
sleep at night.
You don't
sleep at night.
I wake up to.
To check
the markets.
To. To.
Yeah. To.
And if you are going
to allow
insider crypto
trading
like it's happening
right now,
we all see
it happening.
We all do a
little bit of it.
We all we all do.
What is Web4
about?
What is Web4
all about?
Oh. That.
That I'm
not into this.
What is the Web4
all about?
That's a good
question.
Actually.
After the big depression
in Web3 last year,
I decided to check
on my investments
and reassure myself
that crypto
was still fully
focused on
its core value.
Making money.
So I fly to the most
prestigious
conference
in the world.
Better than EthCC,
EthGlobal,
and Bitcoin
Miami Beach.
I go to Web3
Berlin
in 3rd world country
Germany
to talk to tech founders
and other
con artists.
I go to my first panel
to remind
myself what Web3
exactly is,
but I lose focus
and discover
the most sane
person in the room.
The bouncer.
Who was this
bouncer?
So I interviewed
the bouncer
and taught him
some buzzwords
Now I'm entering
the hallways
of the conference,
There are
more exhibitors
than participants.
I'm now trying
to talk to
some of the
unsuccessful
startups
to see what
still drives them
to squeeze
the last satoshis
out of Bitcoin.
Describe
your company
in one word.
In one word
in one word.
Adopters.
Transparent.
Blockchain
made for trade finance
probably
fitting
all kinds of use cases
What makes
Flamingo different?
[..] You don't
have to
identify yourself.
You don't have
to identify.
So it's the
perfect platform
for money
laundering.
For me.
That's also
a big thing
that we
consider that
the platform is used
for money
laundering, but
we don't really have
any control
over that.
Shouldn't
we just normalize
insider trading
and mingling
of funds
instead of
the whole pain
of regulation?
I'm not sure if
regulating insider
trading is
the way to go,
because then
you have a
lot of people
being at the top
trying to
extort money
from the people
at the bottom.
When is Flamingo
going to get sued?
We hope never,
because we are based
in Norway.
We escape
the whole American
SEC thing.
We escape
the China thing,
and we also escape
a little bit
the laws
in Europe.
But outside
of Norway,
do you think
there's any exchange
that is operating
legally in Web3
right now?
I think you have
some exchanges
that are paying
all the taxes
and all the fees
and everything
they need to do
to be a
legal exchange.
But I also feel
that they are
not profitable.
So here
I am walking
across the boards
of several scam
companies
that I have invested
in, some of them
in the past.
Who can
we still trust
in crypto and
are there
any genuinely
good people
in crypto?
Yes,
I'm sure there are.
Michael Saylor
has a tax
fraud lawsuit.
Miami Coin
is 99% down.
Bitcoin City
is canceled
and there are
mass incarceration
in El Salvador.
Why do you still
believe in crypto?
I believe
because it
is a promising tech.
A lot of the actual
market is based
a lot on hype
and we try to change
that.
Basically...
You’re trying to
change that?
Exactly.
So we are
based on utility.
You don't have
really
DeFi protocols,
which like
I don’t know
have fancy names,
and
the only thing you do
there is
basically farm.
One of those
I don't know,
pizza token
whatever.
Cheeseburger token.
So you don't believe
in Cheeseburger token?
So I believe
really in
real-world utility
because there
are real-world
utility use cases.
So you are involved
in some of them.
But can you give me
one example?
The problem is
most of
them are under NDA
and I can't
share them publicly.
This is the
networking area.
This is where people
without a job
are trying
to convince people
without a company
to hire them.
How would you
describe poochain
simply?
poochain is the home
for all the
[...] coins.
Me, for example,
I'm working
in a project
poogrow.
Describe to me
the typical
meme coin
enthusiast.
You know the day.
How does he
look like
the typical m..
they are players,
the typical
meme coin enthusiast
I think they are
players too.
Big players.
Also, they
they like to
like to see
the chat hyped.
We're
launching a coin.
It's called
quinoa coin.
At the end
of the month,
I can tell you
right now
it's a typical pump
and dump.
But the project
is very exciting
because many DAO
members from
the DAOs
are going to
be involved.
There's a public
discord already,
but there's also
private discord.
I can invite you to
the private discord.
What the actual
action happens,
Where it
communicates
when you buy,
when you sell,
Not the public one.
The insider
trading one.
If you want,
I can send you
that also.
Let's see.
I will.
I think I will.
I will check out
the community
and more...
Again it's classical
pump and dump.
There's literally
no utility Yeah,
eh do
you have telegram?
I sold my house.
I lost 2 boats
because of crypto.
Michael Saylor
brought me
into this.
He said Bitcoin
is going to
go to 100,000
and now we're here.
And all of my NFT
are useless.
Yeah it dependence.
NFTs have
a use case.
At this time,
you have
already the case
that if you
invest in NFTs
like 90% of the time
they depreciate
in value.
Main reason
why all this
kind of tokens
of ...
people are holding
their tokens
because they don't
want to move them
because
it will cost them
too much in fees.
Can we end
the session
with a
Show-your-NFT?
Do you have
your NFT
wallet with you?
Yes, but I actually
I don't have
that much NFTs.
There was an update
an update from metamask
Since then
all of my NFTs
We have.
Yeah,
but my colleague
was just...
Oh you don't have
a personal
NFT wallet.
I but.
You lost your
NFT wallet?
So it just
we have a
But
do you have
an NFT or
do you want my NFT?
Do you have Azukis
I do not have
Azukis.
unfortunately
Do you
have cryptopunks.
Do you have
bored apes?
I do not have...
So you're not
going to be
on the bored ape
party later on?
No.
I don't know if they’re..
This is your wallet?
This guy could buy
the entire
conference.
Will you be
at the bored ape
yacht party later?
I don't know yet
for sure.
Okay. But...
Can you bring me in?
We can talk
about that
in a moment.
Okay.
I'm actually
in it
for the tech.
I like
the technology.
You're not in it
for the money.
I.
I have made
my money already.
Okay, okay.
So now I really believe
in how it works.
If it's like
a cult, who
is the leader?
I think right now
the leader
is
profit.
I realized Web3
became a cult,
just like Agile.
Finally
let us get lifted
by the spirit
of Agile
Scrum ceremonies
Scrum poker
Alignment meetings
So then finally,
finally,
there is no time
left anymore to
Alright
Who’s down for gamification?
Yeah.
GM
GM
GM
GM
GM
So this is the entire conference
It’s only one floor
for both
the people who lost money
and the people who lost crypto.
If you put your money
into
[...] coins
that you don't trust
or that you don't
really know
that they are going
to succeed.
For me,
personally,
I don't sleep
at night.
 Now, Flamingo is not
just for trading.
There's also DeFi
use cases
and there's
lots of these things
so we have
DeFi
DeSci
DePi
DePly
DeMy
DeCry
DeGi
Correct.
and DeLy
yeah.
It’s the first time I heard about Web
