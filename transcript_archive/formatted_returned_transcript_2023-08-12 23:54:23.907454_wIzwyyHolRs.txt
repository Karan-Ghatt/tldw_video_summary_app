oh shoot that was awesome so I don't
think about how much codes you have to
hecation to get that thing to
think don't my goodness all right for
those that don't know this is from uh
Django conf 2022 from react to htmx on a
real world SAS product so it's not like
some toy application it's actually a
real world thing going from the full
power of react industry standard react
to HDMX which everyone says is the
world's worst thing ever and they have a
horse head for a logo or something like
that and in their web industry for 15
years I've been a jungle developer for
five years I work at context yes it's
the French word for context
um I don't think I can even understand
this why is there an e at the end is
that what French people do you guys put
ease at the end of things and I'm here
to talk to you about an experiment we
we've been running at my work uh it's
about replacing react with htmx on a SAS
product that was already in production
and it's a good experience
okay
so this talk is about realizing what is
possible when it comes to a modern UI
Rich UI on the web so I'll start by
breaking some misbeliefs about front-end
development I will show you our UI I
will show you some code then I will tell
you our story and finally I will share
some thoughts and learning about all
this
I am pretty excited about this
um I love this meme by the way this meme
is fantastic 2004 2021 same thing
so
um
this is the the cover of htmx Twitter
account
um it's Creative Commons by the way
um
you've heard for too many years now that
uh
for a rich ux on the web you need you
have to go the react way you have to
to build an API and build a single page
app and
you will have everything you need
probably the reality is a bit more open
than that
yeah because what makes a ux rich
probably there is something about making
the user forgetting they're looking at a
web browser
um
for example when the user acts on your
interface and they changes the the
application State you want to react to
this change and you don't want to reload
the full page because yes so 2005.
um to be fair pay the The View
transition API coming up and all that
does kind of change a lot of these
perspectives I always I know I always
harp on this just shut up front end
Masters right when you click links
you're literally doing a full page
reload uh but like you can't really feel
it because they just have such highly
optimized
interface
that it is not really bad and when they
integrate when the view API becomes
everywhere
it's just going to it's going to look
like a non-page transition and it's
going to be fantastic and so when you
look at this you you have to think to
yourself how the heck is this thing so
fast how how is this guy how's this guy
right here Netflix by the way what is
that all about but uh there's like a
this is really cool right
it's really it's probably the fastest
page I've ever visited exactly there's a
lot of really cool things about what
they've built and you can see it in the
speed and even even Mark the the guy who
wrote a lot of this or some portion of
that code by the way he wrote jQuery
date picker the guy who wrote front end
Masters wrote jQuery date picker anyone
from the old web loves jQuery date
picker can we all agree that's the
greatest library ever created in the
universe okay I know damn hell yeah this
guy's great anyways uh very excited
about it he loves he actually even said
some some things that are positive about
htmx he's like huh that's pretty cool
which is like a huge like for him to say
pretty cool
that's a decent sized one gold standard
today picker it is the gold standard for
date picker
another pouch is you you want to have
some beautiful UI elements smooth
reliable reusable accessible like the
ones you've got on your phone
I'm gonna go 1.5 speed simply because uh
since he's not obviously a native
English speaker I don't want it to
become too hard to understand him
especially since a lot of you aren't
native English speakers then you're
listening to somebody on high speed not
natively speaking English who then you
have like the translation becomes too
great so we're gonna keep it with 1.25
and
you've heard that to get all this you
need to go the JavaScript application
framework way like react on
something else
but
when it comes to reacting to application
State changes
you you will hear that you need an
application on the client side to to
duplicate the application State on the
client side to to be able to react very
smoothly
probably
there are other ways and htmx is one of
them so HTML Big Sky software let's go
Bozeman Montana stop it grounds next
what is it basically it's listening to
JavaScript events in order to fire some
Ajax calls get him getting some HTML
fragment and
inserting this HTML fragment into the
Dom
that's it
when it comes to web components because
that's I was that's what I was talking
about when when I said reached UI
elements
the the best way the the design pattern
to get rich UI elements is to build
isolated reusable components that that
are pieces of HTML codes CSS code and
JavaScript code that will work together
in order to get
some beautiful UI elements that you will
be able to reuse anywhere in your
application and even in other
applications
and we were told that in order to
achieve that we need JavaScript
application Frameworks that force you to
think component oriented oriented and to
get web components
now is it possible on the server side in
jungle world yes it is
I think this is actually a really good
kind of uh
uh observation he's making because if
you remember when react was originally
sold it was sold as the v in MVC it was
just the view part and you really
started thinking really you know you
really started thinking in this very
component
like model perspective that was a little
bit different but then data fetching and
everything started kind of all flooding
towards it because it became kind of you
know a golden Hammer in some sense and
so then all of a sudden you were no
longer it was no longer an MVC pattern
but some sort of like M but then it's
like MVC C right like it started like
bringing in all the logic into react or
into the react portion of the code it's
very interesting this guy
implemented some library that that
allows you to to get web components
within Django templating and I will show
you some code about it
now it's demo time
um
our UI in our product in production
um how disappointing would it be that if
he whips it out and it's just like
literally a page of text it's like no
styles
he's like I'm about to show you it okay
are you ready clicks over and it's just
like the world's most disappointing
website of all dive you're just like
quite sophisticated screen that I will
show you uh and when it comes to ux I
will present it briefly first and then I
will dive into two features I want to
show you to illustrate application State
changes and UI elements
all right come on let's see this so
oh that's really nice
so this is a
um a screen that is
um
at the top you get a navigation timeline
did you see that this bottom part loads
in later
so so it comes and loads and all this
and then this thing's waiting and then
it comes in remember to be completely
Fair he's at a conference there's like
200 300 Wi-Fi receivers in the same room
as he is which means that the the
reception just sucks so even under a
heavy amount of like uh packet loss is
probably like 40 even under that it's
still loaded pretty Snappy this is a um
a screen that is quite Central in our
user experience at the top you've got a
navigation timeline
when you click on one of them you get a
beautiful animation you get some stuff
that reloads on the bottom of the page
I can close that one for now
on the right column you'll get a text
see that it just close it can be a huge
text but it's just text the rendering is
very quick
stacked is split into articles the
Articles can be seen
just when opening the table of contents
I can mark an article as favorite
When I close my table of contents My
article has been marked as my favorite
here
is it client-side application State
Management no it isn't
okay who hears a little bit shocked that
that's just htmx
that's all server side driven
functionality with virtually no
JavaScript executing at all other than
the htmx little hook-ins to send stuff
this is
okay so I I wasn't expecting this level
of sophistication honestly I was not
expecting this level of sophistication I
was not it's htmx
it's just
a JavaScript event
triggering some
very very located reload
on the left side you've got
a list of items that are related to the
text this list of items can be quite
huge here we have more than 1000 items
in this list
it's huge and it works it loaded just
fine
and this list can be filtered
for example by articles there are two 10
items related to article 2.
sorry the quality htmx stuff
I can also
search something
that will match
um projectors shoot it's from a potato
an actual potato
and let's reset now let's dive into
[Music]
um
one feature that illustrates quite
sophisticated application State
Management wow that you you could think
it is at least so in this facet filter I
have all my articles with counters of
results
and at the top of the of the filter I
have a special bucket here which is all
the Articles I'm interested in all the
articles I marked as favorite so for now
I have only Article 1 and Article 2 as
favorites so the counter is 127 results
because it's 117 Plus 10. what happens
if I'm not interested in article first
anymore
just here the Contour has been updated
is it some client-side application State
Management no is there some JavaScript
for achieving this no zero nine of
JavaScript
this is just htmx all the way do you
want to see how it works
awesome so think about how much code you
have to have in your application to get
that thing to work oh my goodness
get get gas oh no this is the
the jungle View for the watch button I
hope this is readable on big screen
uh obviously I have a post method and uh
when I built my if I showed again showed
again okay so what happened is this may
not seem very impressive but this is
like a classic hard issue in general in
web development which is you have
somewhere within your code
that updates a uh a value and somewhere
else on the screen the completely
unrelated component they have to react
to that thing right this is where Redux
tens of thousands of lines of code have
been put in to State Management just to
do this one little thing no one wants to
use like no one hey whoa are you
suggesting a global event bus we don't
do that here we do tens of thousands of
lines of code to prevent us from having
a global event bus okay we don't do that
around here but anyways so you can see
right here he's talking about how to get
a couple of them do you want to see how
it works yeah favorite let's reset all
right now let's dive into
[Music]
um
management
that you you could think it is articles
with a count here which is all the
Articles I'm interested in all the
articles I marked as Facebook right here
so now I have only Article 1 and Article
2 as favorites so the counter is 127
results
117 plus 10. there we go what happens if
I'm not interested in article first
anymore
just here the Contour has been updated
from client-side application statement
agent no is there some JavaScript for
achieving this no zero line of
JavaScript
this is just htmx all the way do you
want to see how it works
let's dive in I know this doesn't sound
impressive because honestly increase the
resolution you can't okay this is an
older video you can't see it uh remember
this is a video in 720p of a screen
that's probably projecting in 480p so
you're getting like double resolution by
the way hmx solution is this is an event
bus I know because event buses are the
way to do it honestly event buses have
always been the way to do things and
people will do anything but use an event
bus
they'll do anything in the world but use
an event bus which is wild
Chad's saying it is an htmax actually JS
it's like saying it's JS is it's
actually dude is that not the fast uh
actually that's just C plus plus you're
executing okay Fred so uh this is the
the jungle View for the watch button I
hope this is can we take a second here
though as developers he just just I want
you to just say it in English what
happened he clicked a button and a
number updated and we're all over there
like holy
oh my God
oh my God oh my God oh
like what has happened to our brain can
we all agree that that feels a little
stupid when you say it out loud
when you say it out loud do you feel
stupid because you should because it is
stupid that we're that impressed it
means that we've added complexity out of
this world to things maybe that
shouldn't react right this is react
break this is framework brain that
fitting everything through a framework
might hurt us emotionally
why I can't hang out with people it's
why I can't hang out with people this is
how you feel in front of non-de like
non-devs you do something you're like
holy cow and they're like what it's
barely working you're like no you shut
up you don't know what just happened
there did you see that number go up that
throbber was like throb throb throb boom
double upgrade same time and they're
like I don't even know what you're
saying you're like you shut up it's
amazing when I built my HTTP response
becoming yellow or green according uh
according the post yeah all right
oh so I saw this I was reading about
this laugh HTTP header which is a
special HTTP header that htmx understand
on the client side
now my small
counter here actually it's the whole
line
in my HTML template
which is
here
look at that beautiful
with a bunch of htmx attributes and this
empty div is about to to get its content
from the server on page load and also
when an article is watched and when an
article is unwatched
this is quite simple isn't it and again
you have some events application set
management without writing a single line
of client-side code
the second feature I wanted to show you
is about rich UI by the way people
always be like well what if you don't
what if you weapon if you don't have
internet well you're not going to be
using the web page anyways you're not
going to be unmarking things and having
it saved anyways what is all this stuff
you're talking about almost no company I
know of has a rich offline experience
other than Google Docs okay don't give
me that don't give me that offline
business okay every one of you are all
talking
inside of twitch chat talking about the
importance of offline without actually
ever using things offline elements
actually you've seen them already it's
these facet filters we have three of
them what if you don't have jsons
Sophisticated You element because
it's a custom drop down you make your
page for SEO
htmx actually does fall back and work
very very well for non-javascript but
nonetheless this is just it just I hate
that say what if there's no JavaScript
yeah react's gonna work really well
there tough guy react is gonna just be a
just just just do fantastic your little
used clients are going to execute so
well oh my goodness you're right you're
absolutely right already did probably
such things
um I can close it when actually anywhere
close it by hitting escape and there is
some internal search
oh there is no article I'm not an
articles
it's called one an article 9 for example
um this is some JavaScript of course
because it is client-side pure user
interaction
nice but these elements are actually web
components made on Jungle site
so
I have a
face set template which is a regular
Django template that will take some
input the the bucket the values what the
user selected Etc
and this face said this HTML template is
working with
in my static folder components face it I
have some CSS code
and I also have some JavaScript for
example did he not hold on did he not
just have Tailwind
okay where's Tailwind what is this
what is this child's project it's a
little baby little baby child's project
is that what we're looking at
little baby little baby little babies
I don't want to see this
stuff his uh his English accent is
actually exceptionally great I work with
quite a few French people on ironically
I don't know what it is about
infrastructure in French people but I
work with a lot of them and I swear
this guy has an incredible English
accent
uh for because you can hear it you can
he or a credible uh English French
accent in his English it's really really
good it's very very good we use stimulus
uh on JavaScript but you can use
whatever you want look at that and all
of this is working together through
uh jungle components and jungle
components allow you to
declare a component here that make that
bring together the template the CSS and
the JavaScript oh cool and that makes
you able to to pass some data into it
and this is how you achieve UI web
components on set aside with jungle
components and how do you use it I will
open my well it's actually really cool
template again
and here it goes we were there two
minutes ago
you have your component
s
so it's really completely reusable I
have another one here for another field
in my data
and I passed the buckets into it I pass
whatever you the user selected in order
to
to mark them
this way
and very cool I have slots slots
allowing me to to do special stuff to
customize for example this filter you've
got some color dots
names
here it goes I have my slot and I have
the possibility to customize some stuff
in there
so it's reusable it's isolated we can
unit test it if we want we can upgrade
it add some features independently from
its usage in our application and that's
the whole point of web components
so that's the end of the demo part that
is really really good I hope at this
point you are convinced that yes our UI
is quite quite Rich offers a rich user
experience and no our code is not
spaghettical because we don't have code
htmx does everything almost everything
for us there is something to be said
that you could affect
rud app with some templates and you
could get interactivity to that level I
mean yeah they're the I mean he did show
a couple sprinkled in javascripts it's
true there's a couple sprinkles of
JavaScript fair fair but nonetheless
like
it's just
crud
Plus templating
and that was an incredible
that was that was a very sophisticated
app
is HTML not a programming language
absolutely it's not a programming
language
no it's a money generator experience at
context all right and the road wasn't
always like this the protest this
project started in 2017
um it's a quite complex project
especially on the back-end side there
are many
domain complex domain stuff but on the
front end side
in 2017 we were a very very small team
it was our first SAS product and we
asked around us how do we do that and
everybody told us the same thing it's
2017 guys go the react way build an API
build spa and you will achieve a
client-side application application
State Management you will get a
separation of concerns between your
backend and your front end you will get
web components it's the modern way to go
so we tried it we hired a JavaScript
developer we I was in charge of the API
among other things and
it was quite of a kind of okay we were
able to kind of okay
is like 25 percent
you got a half of a half
that means it's you're not that's bad
that's called it sucked it's kind of
okay
that's called sucking
mid-mid okay it was like
here's mid and then like another mid you
know what I mean production
but
what is the hdmax recently because the
the API contract was not a little bit
because the the dumb tree was way too
deep and as you as you have seen we have
lots of information to to put into the
browser
um
and uh we had a very very low team
velocity and that was a big problem
because we were trying to launch a
product we were trying to to have people
buy our product so we needed to to be
agile about it and uh uh there were
you know 2017 that's when hooks came out
right
uh just just to make sure because
they're in like modern react right uh
react hooks when did they come out
ah okay so so they came out a little bit
a little bit afterwards okay so you
worked on quote-unquote Modern one so
there was a lot of higher order
components during those days
uh okay I could understand that it was
it was a harder landscape to do good
react
no code quality on the front-end side
because the JavaScript
he was overwhelmed with all the
complexity of making an Spa
um
so when I heard about
Phoenix live view in The Elixir world
when I heard about hotwired in the Ruby
world when I heard about unpoli htmx
I had an idea I created a proof of
concept I duplicated our UI which was
all react I duplicated it with several
rendered Django templates and just a bit
of htmx in one month of work the code
was ugly as hell but the proof was there
it was working the performances were
good
let's refactor it one month later we had
web components we had uh code quality we
had we even had tests that we didn't
have before on the on the react World
so
consequences on the ux were there some
negative consequences on the ux no we we
made no trade-offs I can't think of a
feature we used to have and we don't
have anymore
and it opened it even opened some new
possibilities some new opportunities
um for example on the the left column
you've seen earlier which has many many
many items
on the react World uh the the cons no
Pros yeah yeah
country was so deep and so heavy that
this colon was able to display only 50
items at a time and so it's scroll to
display to replace the 50 items Etc and
oh I hate those virtual scrollers
as light as possible Dom tree we are
able to display thousands of elements
and no lags
that's actually super cool because you
know there is a cost to
to having to displace smaller amounts of
things you are making a very chatty
client and trying to get these you know
you're trying to get the data constantly
whereas when you just load when you have
the availability to just load what you
need you can actually make a lot of less
of those calls and then the remainder of
the calls are all like mutations of data
um we measured time to Interactive
um
on three scenarios jungle and react
jungle API and react on first load then
on second load
and with htmx htmx is at least as fast
as the react second load on first load
is way faster and it happens that in our
use case users often get to our UI
through a deep link that they receive by
email so the first load is really
important to us
and I assume that this the second load
is largely going to be server time is
hopefully what we hear and react was
just not the right fit for it
the memory usage on the client side is
also very lower much lower so this is
good news because we will we will stop
hearing our users crying for a new
laptop every six months
which is good for the planet
that's what happened to the team
obviously the JavaScript developer left
oh the JavaScript developer left okay I
was about to say did I just hear an rip
because there's four and now there's
three something something htmx taking
jobs htmx takes jobs because we didn't
need here anymore but
feels bad
um feels bad the other two uh we were
quite stuck in our back end only role
the
the the most beautiful demonstration I
did after each Sprint was an API
endpoint with Json the
now we are full stack and we are able to
collaborate with designers and also
obviously continue working on our
complex backend issues but
um we have a much wider scope and this
is much more exciting as a developer at
least from my perspective
um
and this allowed also as to to explore
new
this part is so important too it is you
because you know there is something I
mean okay so to be fair I don't
necessarily want to always be doing
front end and all that and maybe you
don't want to do front end so being able
to be exclusively back end is a very
huge bonus but if you want to play that
full stack row if or full stack roll and
you want to be able to see kind of
things change you want to be able to
kind of go on both sides like
this is really
really exciting right he finally sold
out I finally sold management uh methods
I don't know this is a really important
thing right here make the developer in
charge of there's also one more thing
that I think is really important right
here is that full stack devs if they're
all doing the same thing how much what
do you think you get out of this as a
company
what you get out of this is that you
have devs who could really like help out
on a myriad of things whereas when you
have this separation going on right here
what you actually get out of it is like
this these these isolation issues where
it's very hard when there's a real back
end tough thing you can't really send
the full stack guy in full stack guy's
not you know he's he's only good sort of
good on both right oh this guy cannot
help out on any front end things right
like you make a two engineer requirement
on almost every single bug fix and it
causes some weird issues whereas with
this you don't have that you have much
more of an adaptable tree a team that
can actually do a lot more and so there
is something very magical about having a
product that you can everyone can work
on everything
right
there is something very very important
about that
picture from the beginning to the end by
exploring data I think they want to
explain uh scenario working with the
developers it's great
this is
what I want to see
that's this is uh these are lines of
code oh baby
we deleted 15 000.
look at kid look at this you go it went
up a little bit in Python but look at
the down look at the look at this thing
look at the difference
21
000 lines of JavaScript like okay so
when people say that JavaScript sucks
this is one of the reasons why to write
something it feels so easy to write but
you end up writing so much more code you
don't write boilerplate but you write
tons of logic that's not needed
necessarily lines of code
the JS depths also are wild I want to
understand that now why didn't we talk
about that what does this mean right
here
he has 49 python
oh subdaps oh four okay yeah okay I see
it okay I thought because I was trying
to line it up this way I thought even
they're like I was trying to line it up
that way okay my bad my bad this is wild
though
yeah
no
um
when it comes to you
uh because I'm a bit here to convince
you but the building to give you 40
seconds for five seconds
I think you need to make your own
decision
you need to ask yourself what do we need
more as a team as a business
um because
in the beginning of this presentation I
told you that he recommended react to me
uh talked about reacting to application
State Management okay this is over uh
talk they talk to me about web
components okay this is handled they
talk to me about separation of concerns
and
from that perspective with htmx we have
um less separated uh code base and uh
to me it's a good thing because I like
to be a full stack developer but if your
team let me just take a second did they
blur his shirt
it looks like his shirt is blurred that
camera
this is just not that great it's used to
separation a heavy separation of
concerns between backhand and front end
Maybe
um htmx is not the best way for you
but it says react what htmx gave us is
Project agility we are now able to ship
much faster much much faster uh we we
have no more uh endless debates about
API contracts Etc
interesting uh so if product agility is
uh
a big thing for you maybe you should
consider htmx
another question is what is front-end
development
um
if some of you hate CSS Maybe
maybe you should consider
um an architecture that allows you to
focus on the back end and let other
people work on the front end but that
doesn't necessarily mean reactor
JavaScript application framework but if
you think that front-end development is
about taking some data from the database
and exposing exposing the data to the
user in a beautiful way
interact with your data every day so
store the data into the database
maybe htmx is the way to go
I'm I think I'm done almost
um here are the key takeaways form for
you the first one is is if you had some
thoughts about htmx does it work on a
real project a real product
yes it works people are paying for the
UI that you've seen earlier so it works
um for a small team like us on a B2B SAS
product it makes us very happy so if
you're in the same position or if you're
in a similar position maybe it would
make you happy so
and the most important thing is that
with htmx with jungle components as well
now you're able to to make your own
choice about
what architecture will we Implement for
our front end
this time I'm really done
I would like to give a special thanks to
my colleagues at context I'd like to to
tell you that this awesome company gave
me to you the opportunity to work on
this presentation in my working time my
working time so this is great good
that's very good and like the people you
see here gave me feedback about the
presentation they helped me rewrite it
three times but it was great and the
girls of the tech team took care of I
will take stuff while I was working on
this presentation so this is good
and thank you for your attention uh you
can you can't find me anywhere else than
on GitHub I have no social network
um and I have one more thing if there
are some French here we are hiring so
let's meet later
good God
oh that got loud at the end
uh that was awesome
that was awesome
that
was so cool okay you gotta just take a
second and appreciate that like
if you would have saw that application
you would have said there is absolutely
no way that htmx could have done that
application or at least your brain right
would anyone in here genuinely would
have thought htmx was the way to go with
that it looked very interactive right
there's a lot of throbbers there was
menus coming in there was overlays there
was like everything going and you
figured there's no way that's not that's
not an htmx site there's no way uh but
yeah it's not only hvx of course it's
not only htmx they had a couple like
bits of JavaScript which is totally it
throbbers you're into it yeah I'm into
it too baby that's why we say it I don't
what else would you call them but uh huh
throbbers you don't know what throbbers
are
really I'm not gonna google it but you
you just know that uh
can't hear you
uh but
there is something about that that is
actually extremely impressive which is
perhaps my Paradigm has been wrong this
whole time and maybe perhaps maybe
we've gotten it wrong for the last
little bit
just throwing it out there I know I'm
asking it again I don't I still don't
see why hmx is better maintaining State
on this uh server seems Seems harder or
at least no no it's not it's it's it's
definitely easier because you have one
place of Truth the thing is with a with
react you have two places of Truth at
all points now with react server
components all you've done is just make
it so now you have a new problem client
server spaghetti issues right and this
is why so many people have such a hard
time with it is because there is this
whole new paradigm you have to try to
come up with and not shoot yourself in
the foot constantly and so it's having
one place that's authoritative is always
true
it will always 100 be true xss is not a
real thing
when I say it's when I say it's not a
real thing I mean yes of course if you
send down to this client HTML the HTML
will happen it's up to you to not
send down xss it's not like that problem
somehow goes away when you use react you
can still do the same thing to yourself
it's just now your server has to your
server is the one that just goes this is
the correct thing you're templating
right like when you use golang templates
when you when you go over here and you
use uh you know golang uh look at me
I've been using golang for like 14
seconds when you use this it right away
comes with this idea that it prevents
xss from happening right this whole
document is about security features it
just prevents it from happening so you
write the code you want and you don't
accidentally do the wrong thing
right why does everyone because because
we think in terms of direction right we
think and like you don't ever think
about something by itself and what I
mean by that is that no one thinks about
the front end and goes oh I'm a blank
slate tell me about how this thing works
no they go okay this is how a front end
Works react how does this work I don't I
don't see how I can do this over here
this must be bad right that's like
that's how our brains work this is why
it's hard to learn new things things
that are completely novel is because
your brain tries to take what it knows
and tries to map it to something you
don't know and that's always just super
hard right that will always end forever
be a super hard thing to do and so there
you go
leptos plus htmx I've been doing a
goaling I'm trying out golang I did
leptos it's all I'm always super hard
exactly picks just a constantly novel
like dude he's novel all the time and
sometimes some people get a little
uncomfortable with how novel he is and
you know we're trying to let him know
maybe not like maybe not all the you
know maybe not all the time you need to
